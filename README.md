# MINECRAFT SERVER SCANNER

This is a minecraft server scanner as a windows app. You can scan for recently active servers and get it's metadata about both the server and it's recently join players and much much more.

# Updates
This project is still in early development and will receive active updates to make it more better while adding qol changes. i might soon port this in a minecraft mod for fabric but i can't say this for sure if i do or not.

# Api
